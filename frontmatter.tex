\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

Creating a backend to the Ypnos programming language to support GPU accelerated
computation. This will require the implementation of translation from the Ypnos
stencil syntax to GPU code. Furthermore, it will require, as a minimum, two
language primitives to be implemented: \emph{run} and \emph{reduce}. Both the
translation and primitives must be correct and, furthermore, outperform the CPU
implementation.
